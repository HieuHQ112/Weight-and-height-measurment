# Weight-and-height-measurment
This Arduino project measures a person's height using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor. The height is calculated by subtracting the measured distance from a fixed reference (e.g., ceiling height). The result is displayed in both meters and inches on a 128x64 OLED display.
